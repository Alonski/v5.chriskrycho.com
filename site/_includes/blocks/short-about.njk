   I’m <span class='p-author p-name'>Chris Krycho</span>—a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad. I’m a <a href='/cv/'>software engineer</a> by trade; a writer, podcaster, and occasional composer by hobby; and a theologian by vocation.

   Outside this site, I also publish a roughly-weekly newsletter, <a href='https://buttondown.email/chriskrycho'><cite>Across the Sundering Seas</cite></a>; cohost and produce <a href='https://www.winningslowly.org'><cite>Winning Slowly</cite></a>, a podcast about technology, religion, ethics and art; and occasionally write at <a href='https://mereorthodoxy.com'>Mere Orthodoxy</a>.
