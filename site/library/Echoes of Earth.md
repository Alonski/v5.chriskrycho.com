Saturday, in need of some “popcorn”-style fiction—light reading, heavy on fun and lower on the deeply-serious fare than a lot of what I’ve been reading of late—I went poking around in search of books akin to <cite>The Expanse</cite>: solid sci-fi adventure in the space opera vein. Several mentioned <cite>{{book.title}}</cite> and the Orphans Trilogy of which it is the first part. I gave it a try via Kobo and liked it well enough to give the rest of it a read.

I wasn’t disappointed in this romp of a story, equal parts first contact narrative and early-21st-century Ray Kurzweil-influenced futurism. Bonus points for being both much better storytelling *and* much more realistic—which is to say, *pessimistic*—than Kurzweil’s *own* take on AI.
