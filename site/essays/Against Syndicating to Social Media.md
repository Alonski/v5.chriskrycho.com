<!-- TODO: this is the wrong intro -->
As I continue setting up this new version of my website, I am evaluating which pieces of the [IndieWeb] I want to implement, and which I do not. As I write this I am mulling on POSSE: <i>Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</i>. The idea itself I very much support. [Own your turf!] However, this site does not—and will not, in any future I can foresee—syndicate content to Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.

*[POSSE]: Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere

This decade has seen the major social media players become ever-more embedded in public life. Strange to say of services still less that two decades old, but they *seem* institutions. Whether they *are* institutions—whether they have any lasting power, or will in fact fade away—is impossible to say. For the moment, they wield not only the power of great wealth but that of being perceived as necessary: in Facebook and Instagram’s case, to personal life; in Twitter’s, to political life.[^twitter]

That sway has all sorts of pernicious effects. It lets malicious actors [magnify][stephen-on-twitter-bots] mere vapors into cultural nightmares. It too readily narrows our personal and political lives into the shapes that are [amenable to being digitized][narrows]. It actively enables [mob behavior][mob]. It functions as simulacrum of [“community”][community], providing just enough social connection to kneecap the urgency of actually having dinner with friends. It regularly provokes politicians and journalists to [mistakenly believe][extremely-online] the Extremely Online are representative of everyone else. It tends to lead us to think first of broadcasting an experience.[^instagram-coffee-shop] It profoundly confuses our understanding of the commons and the nature of [free speech][free-speech] (political and otherwise).

It is not by any means that social media are devoid of good. To the contrary: my life has been enriched enormously by social media.[^adn] Nor, in this case, is it merely that my own mental life is [better][on-micro.blog] for being [off social media][breaking-up]—even [healthy][micro.blog] social media.

[^twitter]: For the tech-geek world, Twitter largely functions as the same kind of social space Facebook does for “normal” people.

[^instagram-coffee-shop]: As I was writing this section of the essay at my favorite local coffee shop, early on a Saturday morning, I looked up to see a stunning sunrise. To my “Ohhhh, wow!” one of the baristas responded, “Instagram time!” It is not that the act of sharing a photo of a lovely moment which is bad—more on this later in the essay—but that broadcast has primacy over delight in the goodness of a thing itself.

[^adn]: Notably: primarily by *non-mainstream* social media, especially [App.net]. Twitter was beneficial primarily to me as a marketing mechanism for [New Rustacean].
