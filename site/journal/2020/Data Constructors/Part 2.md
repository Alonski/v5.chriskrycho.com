Yesterday‚Äôs discussion covered everything you need to know to understand what‚Äôs happening in ‚Äúdata constructors‚Äù in languages in the Standard ML (SML) lineage. However, I intentionally used a minimal subset of TypeScript‚Äôs features to make it as approachable as possible for readers coming from other languages like Java or C^‚ôØ^. TypeScript provides tools we can use to implement the same idea more robustly *and* with better performance, though. In this post, I‚Äôll explore two of those‚Äîwith the hope that you come out with a better idea of how to do interesting things with some pieces of TypeScript‚Äôs type system:

1. [A variation on the theme](#a-variation-on-the-theme): an implementation that is very similar to the one we built in the previous post, but with better performance *and* more type safety.
2. [Something totally different](#something-totally-different): the more idiomatic implementation you would see in most TypeScript codebases‚Äîequally type-safe, and with very *different* performance characteristics.

*[SML]: Standard ML
*[TS]: TypeScript

## A variation on the theme

We can make this existing implementation lighter-weight *and* more robustly type-safe by leaning into a set of ‚Äúfancy‚Äù features in TypeScript: const enums,[^1] literal types, tuple types, and union types.

Here‚Äôs the final version we‚Äôll end up with:

```ts
const enum CabbageColor {
  Red,
  Green,
}

const enum VeggieKind {
  Broccoli,
  Cabbage,
  Squash
}

type VeggieData =
  | [VeggieKind.Broccoli]
  | [VeggieKind.Cabbage, CabbageColor]
  | [VeggieKind.Squash];

class Veggie {
  private data: VeggieData;

  private constructor(data: VeggieData) {
    this.data = data;
  }

  static Squash = new Veggie([VeggieKind.Squash]);

  static Cabbage(color: CabbageColor): Veggie {
    return new Veggie([VeggieKind.Cabbage, color]);
  }

  static Broccoli = new Veggie([VeggieKind.Broccoli]);

  match<Output>(matcher: {
    squash: Output,
    cabbage: (color: CabbageColor) => Output,
    broccoli: Output,
  }): Output {
    switch (this.data[0]) {
      case VeggieKind.Squash:
        return matcher.squash;
      case VeggieKind.Cabbage:
        return matcher.cabbage(this.data[1]);
      case VeggieKind.Broccoli:
        return matcher.broccoli;
    }
  }
}
```

Let‚Äôs break that down, using the differences from our first implementation to explain each of the new concepts we‚Äôre covering:

1. [Const enums](#1-const-enums)
2. [Literal types](#2-literal-types)
3. [Tuple types](#3-tuple-types)
4. [Union types](#4-union-types)
5. [Putting it together](#5-putting-it-together)

### 1. Const enums

A `const enum` declaration works much the same as a normal `enum` declaration in Typescript, but it has one critical difference: normal `enum` declarations have a (surprisingly complicated) compiled output that still exists at runtime, while `const enum`s are compiled out of existence entirely, replaced by the constant value they represent. (By default, that‚Äôs a number, though you can give it a string value as well.)

Given this `const enum` declaration and usage‚Äî

```ts
const enum ConstEnum { A, B }

function useConstEnum(x: ConstEnum) {
  console.log(x);
}

useConstEnum(ConstEnum.A);
```

‚Äîhere‚Äôs the compiled output (as of TS 3.9.2):

```js
function useConstEnum(x) {
    console.log(x);
}

useConstEnum(0 /* A */);
```

Here is the same code implemented with a plain `enum` instead of a `const enum`:

```ts
enum RegularEnum { A, B }

function useRegularEnum(x: RegularEnum) {
  console.log(x);
}

useRegularEnum(RegularEnum.A);
```

And here is the corresponding output from TS 3.9.2:

```js
var RegularEnum;
(function (RegularEnum) {
    RegularEnum[RegularEnum["A"] = 0] = "A";
    RegularEnum[RegularEnum["B"] = 1] = "B";
})(RegularEnum || (RegularEnum = {}));

function useRegularEnum(x) {
    console.log(x);
}

useRegularEnum(RegularEnum.A);
```

Notice that there is much more code present at runtime for the plain `enum`. Most obviously, it comes with a declaration of a fancy object type. (This is makes it so that you can write `RegularEnum.A` and get out `0` *or* type `RegularEnum[0]` and get out `"A"`.[^2]) Second, note that the call `useRegularEnum(RegularEnum.A)` still refers to that fancy object type:

```js
useRegularEnum(RegularEnum.A);
```

Recall that the compiled call looked like this instead for the `const enum`:

```js
useConstEnum(0 /* A */);
```

This is how TypeScript gets rid of the runtime object representing a `const enum`‚Äîit just substitutes in the concrete values each lookup represents. This means that we can have a *much* lower cost for the enums we‚Äôre using for `CabbageColor` and `VeggieKind`. They will ultimately just be integers used inline, which means they will have extremely low memory costs, and using them does not involve an object lookup!

So the `CabbageColor` and `VeggieKind` declarations in the implementation look like this:

```ts
const enum CabbageColor {
  Red,
  Green,
}

const enum VeggieKind {
  Broccoli,
  Cabbage,
  Squash
}
```

The compiled output for *those* is nothing at all! When we use them later, they‚Äôll just be compiled into integers: `0` for `CabbageColor.Red` and `1` for `CabbageColor.Green` and so on.[^3]

### 2. Literal types

### 3. Tuple types

TypeScript uses JavaScript arrays to represent *tuples*: structured data similar to objects, but without runtime key/value associations.[^4] JavaScript already uses this pattern in a number of places, including [the `Object.entries` API](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries). The syntax to define a tuple type looks like this:

```ts
type ThreeTuple = [string, number, boolean];
```

This is different from the syntax for an array which contains `string`, `number`, and `boolean`:

```ts
type MixedArrayLiteral = (string | number | boolean)[];
type MixedArrayGeneric = Array<string | number | boolean>;
```

When you have a tuple type, the position you index at corresponds to the type in that position in the tuple:

```ts
let threeTuple: ThreeTuple = ["hi", 12, true];

// These all type check!
let first: string = threeTuple[0];  // üëç
let second: number = threeTuple[1]; // üëç
let third: boolean = threeTuple[2]; // üëç

// These will *not* type-check!
let firstBad: boolean = threeTuple[0]; // üëé
let secondBad: string = threeTuple[1]; // üëé
let thirdBad: number = threeTuple[2];  // üëé
```

With an array, each of these would have the type `string | number | boolean` and we would have to *check* which it was, using the `typeof` operator.

A tuple has exactly and only the length of the type defined. If we tried to access or set `threeTuple[3]`, it would be a type error‚Äîunlike with an array, which has an indefinite length.

We can also combine tuple types with literal types, to specify that only a particular value is allowed:

```ts
type Hello12 = ["hello", 12];

let allowed: Hello12 = ["hello", 12];  // üëç

let badFirst: Hello12 = ["greetings", 12]; // üëé
let badSecond: Hello12 = ["hello", 32345]; // üëé
let badBoth: Hello12 = ["goodbye", 98765]; // üëé
```

### 4. Union types

The last feature we need to make our better-performing, more type-safe implementation is *union types*.

[^5]

### 5. Putting it together

## Something totally different

[^1]:	Note: only available when using TS to compile your code! If you‚Äôre using Babel to compile and only using TS to type-check, this doesn‚Äôt work. Compiling out `const enum` declarations requires having information about more than one file; Babel explicitly only works to transform the syntax of a single file.

[^2]:	Why this is necessary, I don‚Äôt know. I have never found a compelling use case for it!

[^3]:	You might worry about whether this means that you can also substitute `VeggieKind.Broccoli` for `CabbageColor.Red`, since they‚Äôd both just have the value `0` at runtime. The answer is *no*: unlike most places in TypeScript, where the ultimate ‚Äúshape‚Äù is the only thing which matters, enums are treated as distinct types based on their *name*. You can see this distinction in practice in [this playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/MYewdgzgLgBApmArgWxgeTHGBvGBBAGhgCEYBfAKFElgRRgBUB3EHfI0yigM0TGCgBLcDG4gQACgAeALnSYAlDkq9+QkQCMAhgCdpc5iCXYuYyYYB0eBQG4K2vRjhXbFIA).

[^4]:	I qualify *runtime* key-value associations because TypeScript 4 is introducing the ability to use labels with tuples. As with essentially all TypeScript features‚Äîexcept non-`const` enums!‚Äîthese have no existence at runtime.

[^5]:	With TypeScript 4.0, we could actually use labeled values for this tuples. The result would be quite expressive while maintaining exactly the semantics we need:

	```TypeScript
	type VeggieData =
	  | [kind: Kind.Squash]
	  | [kind: Kind.Cabbage, color: CabbageColor]
	  | [kind: Kind.Broccoli]
	```
